        <header><h1>Webscraping and analyzing global <em>eBay price data</em> for selected used goods.</h1>
        <aside>We webscrape price data from past auctions of used, undifferentiated goods sold in different Western countries by non-professional eBay sellers. Our focal good is the <em>Apple iPhone X</em> with <em>64</em>GB of storage. We find evidence of heterogeneous sales prices, and diverging bidding behavior&mdash;measured by the average number of bids per auction&mdash;by country. We do not detect outcome differences between ascending eBay auctions and fixed price listings.</aside>
        </header>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Some introduction text. We have a lot of that. But we won't put it here.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Technical Methodology and Data</h2>
            <p>We used a lot of fancy methodologies to scrape data from eBay. First, we cooked a beautiful soup. We seasoned it with an eBay search request. That was something, not that easy to figure out. Then, we took all that clutter extracted from eBay website html elements (in different languages, even), cleaned it, and beautified it into a fan-tas-tic dataset. On that dataset, we were able to deploy some heavy machinery. The big guns: matplotlib, pandas, for-loops, the copilot (which is &mdash; "hi!" &mdash; reading along these lines). The copilot takes over the writing now: We also used some other fancy tools, like the <em>BeautifulSoup</em> library, and the <em>requests</em> library. We also used the <em>time</em> library, and the <em>random</em> library. We also used the <em>re</em> library. We also used the <em>os</em> library. We also used the <em>sys</em> library. We also used the <em>numpy</em> library. We also used the <em>scipy</em> library. We also used the <em>statsmodels</em> library. We also used the <em>sklearn</em> library. We also used the <em>seaborn</em> library. We also used the <em>matplotlib</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.express</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.graph_objects</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.io</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.offline</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.subplots</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.tools</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.validators</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.widgets</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.colors</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.colors.cyclical</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.colors.diverging</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.colors.qualitative</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.colors.sequential</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.colors.sequentialminus</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.data</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.data.carshare</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.data.election</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.data.exoplanets</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.data.gapminder</em></p>

            Thanks, copilot.
    
        <h2>3. Analysis</h2>
        <h3><em>iPhone X</em></h3>
            <p>Here goes the body of the product analysis for the iPhone X
            <!-- Here goes the body of the product analysis for the iPhone X -->
            </p>
            <p>Here comes a nice interactive figure.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Sales prices, number of bids per auction, share of auctions of total listings, by country.
                <iframe type="text/html" src="./out/graph_country_bids_price.html" width="700" height="540" style="border:none;"></iframe>
            </p>

            <p>
            Of course we need a table. Here is a table which demonstrates that iPhones do sell for different prices in different countries. It is a table of the average sales price per country. The table is sorted by the average sales price in descending order. We see how prices are not affected by the mode of sale (fixed price or auction). We also see that the average sales price is highest in the United States, and lowest in the United Kingdom. (This text was written by the copilot which actually figures out that the price was lowest in the U.K. This is a nice feature of the copilot. (The last sentence was again written by the copilot. Martin, please send help.))
            </p>

            <p>Here comes a nice table.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Table 1.</strong> Sales prices v. number of bids per auction, by country.

            </p>

            <p>
            Moving on, we are going to look at some more figures. Like this one. What do you have to say about this, you copilot? Since you are so smart, tell a story about the histograms below. 
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Figure 2 (left).</strong> Distribution of sales prices, by mode of sale.</p>
            <strong>Figure 3 (right).</strong> Distribution of sales prices.</p>
            <div class="slider">
                <a href="#slide-1"></a>
                <a href="#slide-2"></a>
                <div class="slides">
                    <div id="slide-1">
                        <img src="./out/hist_price_auction.png" alt="A first histogram."></div>
                    <div id="slide-2"><p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Finally, we should look at the world. This is a map of some countries in our analysis plotted on a cool map.</p>

            <strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
            <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
            
    <h2>Let it breathe</h2>   
        <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>
        
        <p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
        
    <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
        <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
    
    <h2>Size Matters</h2>
        <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.<p>
    
    <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
        <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
            <p>
                I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.
            </p>
