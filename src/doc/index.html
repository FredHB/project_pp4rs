        <header><h1>Webscraping and analyzing global <em>eBay price data</em> for selected used goods.</h1>
        <aside>We webscrape price data from past auctions of used, undifferentiated goods sold in different Western countries by non-professional eBay sellers. Our focal good is the <em>Apple iPhone X</em> with <em>64</em>GB of storage. We find evidence of heterogeneous sales prices, and diverging bidding behavior&mdash;measured by the average number of bids per auction&mdash;by country. We do not detect outcome differences between ascending eBay auctions and fixed price listings.</aside>
        </header>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Some introduction text. We have a lot of that. But we won't put it here.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Technical Methodology and Data</h2>
            <p>We used a lot of fancy methodologies to scrape data from eBay. First, we cooked a beautiful soup. We seasoned it with an eBay search request. That was something, not that easy to figure out. Then, we took all that clutter extracted from eBay website html elements (in different languages, even), cleaned it, and beautified it into a fan-tas-tic dataset. On that dataset, we were able to deploy some heavy machinery. The big guns: matplotlib, pandas, for-loops, the copilot (which is &mdash; "hi!" &mdash; reading along these lines). The copilot takes over the writing now: We also used some other fancy tools, like the <em>BeautifulSoup</em> library, and the <em>requests</em> library. We also used the <em>time</em> library, and the <em>random</em> library. We also used the <em>re</em> library. We also used the <em>os</em> library. We also used the <em>sys</em> library. We also used the <em>numpy</em> library. We also used the <em>scipy</em> library. We also used the <em>statsmodels</em> library. We also used the <em>sklearn</em> library. We also used the <em>seaborn</em> library. We also used the <em>matplotlib</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.express</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.graph_objects</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.io</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.offline</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.subplots</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.tools</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.validators</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.widgets</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.colors</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.colors.cyclical</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.colors.diverging</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.colors.qualitative</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.colors.sequential</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.colors.sequentialminus</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.data</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.data.carshare</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.data.election</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.data.exoplanets</em> library. We also used the <em>plotly.data.gapminder</em></p>

            Thanks, copilot.
    
        <h2>3. Analysis</h2>
        <h3><em>iPhone X</em></h3>
            <p>Here goes the body of the product analysis for the iPhone X
            <!-- Here goes the body of the product analysis for the iPhone X -->
            </p>
            <p>Here comes a nice interactive figure.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Sales prices, number of bids per auction, share of auctions of total listings, by country.
                <iframe type="text/html" src="../../out/graph_country_bids_price.html" width="700" height="540" style="border:none;"></iframe>
            </p>

            <p>
            Of course we need a table. Here is a table which demonstrates that iPhones do sell for different prices in different countries. It is a table of the average sales price per country. The table is sorted by the average sales price in descending order. We see how prices are not affected by the mode of sale (fixed price or auction). We also see that the average sales price is highest in the United States, and lowest in the United Kingdom. (This text was written by the copilot which actually figures out that the price was lowest in the U.K. This is a nice feature of the copilot. (The last sentence was again written by the copilot. Martin, please send help.))
            </p>

            <p>Here comes a nice table.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Table 1.</strong> Sales prices v. number of bids per auction, by country.

            <p>
            Moving on, we are going to look at some more figures. Like this one. What do you have to say about this, you copilot? Since you are so smart, tell a story about the histograms below. 
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Figure 2 (left).</strong> Distribution of sales prices, by mode of sale.</p>
            <strong>Figure 3 (right).</strong> Distribution of sales prices.</p>
            <div class="slider">
                <a href="#slide-1"></a>
                <a href="#slide-2"></a>
                <div class="slides">
                    <div id="slide-1">
                        <img src="../../out/hist_price_auction.png" alt="A first histogram."></div>
                    <div id="slide-2"><p>
                    <img src="../../out/hist_price.png" alt="Another histogram."></div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Finally, we should look at the world. This is a map of some countries in our analysis plotted on a cool map.</p>

            <iframe type="text/html" src="../../out/world_map.html" width="800" height="500" style="border:none;"></iframe>
            
            <p>And there is one figure still to be placed here. It compares sales prices of used phones by storage. Surprisingly, storage seems not to be a big determinant of price, here.</p>

            <p><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Distribution of sales prices by phone storage.</p>
